# Typing Test

## Overview

This Typing Test application is a personal project developed using **JavaFX**. The program challenges users to type a randomly generated list of words as quickly as possible. After completing the list, users are provided with their **accuracy** and **words per minute**.

## Features

- **Random Word List**: The application generates a new list of 50 random words each time you start the test.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Words change color in real-time based on correctness, providing immediate feedback.
- **Accuracy & WPM**: Once the test is complete, users receive their typing accuracy and words per minute.

## Getting Started

1. **Compile and Run**:
   - Ensure you have **JavaFX** and **Java** installed on your machine.

2. **Usage**:
   - Start the test and type the words as they appear.
